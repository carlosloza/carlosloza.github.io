I"<p>I am currently a Data Scientist at <a href="https://onedrop.today">One Drop</a> where I apply Machine Learning techniques, Data Analytics, and Behavioral Science to help people manage chronic conditions, such as diabetes and highâ€“blood pressure.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://clm.utexas.edu/lclab/">Colgin Lab</a> in the Department of Neuroscience at The University of Texas at Austin. My main focus was the intersection between Machine Learning and Systems Neuroscience.</p>
