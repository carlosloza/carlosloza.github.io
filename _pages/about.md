I am currently a Data Scientist at [One Drop](https://onedrop.today) where I apply Machine Learning techniques, Data Analytics, and Behavioral Science to help people manage chronic conditions, such as diabetes and high--blood pressure.

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Colgin Lab](https://clm.utexas.edu/lclab/) in the Department of Neuroscience at The University of Texas at Austin. My main focus was the intersection between Machine Learning and Systems Neuroscience.
